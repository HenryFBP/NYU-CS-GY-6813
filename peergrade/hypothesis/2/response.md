This hypothesis reads more as a suggestion directed specifically to organizations regarding the use of exploitable MFA methods.

I think that this hypothesis can be changed into something like,

    "MFA schemes that are vulnerable should not be used by organizations because they are vulnerable"

And if we modify it to that, then it reads as a self-describing fact. I think that this paper should try to find some **specific trait** about those vulnerable MFA schemes that makes them vulnerable.

Or, perhaps, why are biological auth schemes more secure, as your hypothesis claims? Are they? Why? Can you prove it? Is there data? What does the data conclude? Could you do more studies?





I think that this paper could improve by making more specific claims to tease out underlying trends or facts.
