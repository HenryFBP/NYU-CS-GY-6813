The hypothesis is not so much of a hypothesis and more of a statement of a model/mechanism, but that's not a bad thing.

I think the model description is specific, makes sense and you summarize it well. Your hypothesis is information-dense and concise.

Because this hypothesis is more of a description, it is not measurable in the same way a traditional hypothesis is, but it can still be measured -- you could look at data breaches, their impact, and how your model could have potentially prevented them, for example.













This problem statement and the paper's title are very specific, and that's a good thing.
