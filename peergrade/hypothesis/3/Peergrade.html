  <h2>An authorization model to comply with data localization for distributed data storage and processing systems</h2>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
  <p>Access control mechanisms for SQL database management systems - such as MS SQL Server, Oracle SQL, and others - are
    not well-suited to modern data localization regulations. This mismatch between regulatory compliance requirements
    and available access control mechanisms poses a security threat to many organizations that operate across multiple
    regulatory jurisdictions. Data localization refers to various policy measures that restrict data flows by limiting
    the physical storage and processing of data within a given jurisdictionâ€™s boundaries [1]. Non-compliance can result
    in significant impact to the business through fines or sanctions [4].</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
  <p>In this work, we propose an access control mechanism that can ease the burden of complying with data localization
    regulations. The mechanism we propose is a combination of mandatory access control and content-dependent access
    control. Data is classified based on its content and labelled appropriately. Data storage and processing centers are
    labelled based on regulatory jurisdiction they are located in and capability to process sensitive data. Data
    policies are created to specify what data sets are allowed to be stored and processed in which data centers. We
    provide a description of a hypothetical database management system that implements this access control mechanism and
    describe how it would help address compliance requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
    studying past and likely data localization breaches and show that most of these breaches would likely be prevented
    in our solution.</p>
