This hypothesis is not well-defined enough to be measurable -- It is specific though.

However, if you chose a specific metric related to passwords/2FA, then it would be easily measurable.

There are likely a large amount of existing studies on 2FA/passwordless auth, security question guessability, etc; that could be leveraged to support/challenge this hypothesis.

It was hard for me to understand the hypothesis of this paper at a glance.

If I understand it correctly, it is:

"Security and user experience  in Online Banking Applications can be improved by reducing password complexity requirements and adding 2FA"

I think that the hypothesis should be broken up and could be more concise.

In addition to this, the hypothesis is difficult to read as it is a single, large paragraph. 

Also, some sentences are grammatically vague/hard to understand -- You never define what "2-step auth" is, you do not cite the "recent study" that showed that [most participants ... were able to answer security questions for other people], etc etc.

This paper could definitely cover some quantitative research and data regarding 2FA, usability/UX in Online Banking apps, password length limits and their implications for security, as well as 2FA and its implications for security. It has the potential to be a really good paper with good data and probably very useful conclusions.
