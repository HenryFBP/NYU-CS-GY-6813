Q1
Does the chart/table effectively convey the comparison? Please explain.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT REQUIRED

It does. I think that this sample metric is useful in showing how a framework like CHEAT could demonstrate the necessity to create human-friendly information systems.
Q2
Can you suggest additional measurements or chart types that could be used?

Statistics on humans bypassing security controls would be fantastic. Some quantifiable data about what controls/combinations work best, or worst.
Q3
Based on your responses to the previous questions, please rate your classmate's response to this prompt and provide a brief written explanation for your rating.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT REQUIRED

Needs improvement: I feel like it is going to be difficult to write a paper that is unaffected by personal bias, knowledge gaps, specific personal interpretations of concepts; etc, if the paper's hypothesis is entirely concerned with the dynamics of an organization that is not real; one that only exists within your mind, and is therefore subject to the aforementioned problems.

My recommendation to fix this issue would be, instead of focusing on an imagined scenario related to human, organization, information system interactions, find a specific way of modeling the behavior of humans within organizations in relation to information systems, and then form a hypothesis based off of that, to eliminate the risk that your paper is written about a scenario that exists only within your imagination. Take this with a grain of salt (don't do it if you really don't want to), because it may be a giant pain in the butt to rewrite this, but it would make your paper more rigorous and generalizable.

The good: I think that this paper is very relevant in its domain and the metric shows that. The industry has a plethora of modernization and migration occurring, and research into how best to create human friendly ISes. And, the CIA triangle is still extremely relevant. If it's secure but unusable, who gives a crap, since you can't use it! Good paper.
