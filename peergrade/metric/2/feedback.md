Section 1
Q1
Does the chart/table effectively convey the comparison? Please explain.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT REQUIRED

No context. I do not know what this data is trying to convey to me other than "As attempts increase, response time in milliseconds increases for REST API authentication attempts"
Q2
Can you suggest additional measurements or chart types that could be used?

Great chart! no context though.
Q3
Based on your responses to the previous questions, please rate your classmate's response to this prompt and provide a brief written explanation for your rating.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT REQUIRED

This is a good chart (I love me some pyplot) but there's no context for why this chart exists. So I can't really give much feedback...

Perhaps it's about how TTR for REST APIs can indicate a successful attack? Or quality of service? Or measuring denial of service? I have no idea.

This may be the prof's fault -- They never explicitly said "Please include your other papers". It'd be nice to see the paper this chart is written for, since you probably made a really nice Jupyter Notebook too, if you've got this high of a quality image of a pyplot chart PNG.
