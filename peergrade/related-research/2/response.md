# Q1
> Does the author describe how their solution is different from current methods in related research?

No.

You don't /explicitly/ say how your solution is different from current methods, but I have never heard of this type of proof-of-work system before, so I'm going to assume that this is.

# Q2
> Did the author miss any papers that should have been included?

No.

There are plenty of papers and they seem relevant and interesting.

# Q3
> Based on your responses to the previous questions, please rate your classmate's response to this prompt and provide a brief written explanation for your rating.

Average.

There was a prompt that had an outline for how to create the "related research" section -- I missed it as well, because it was not present in the 'peergrade.io' website. We're supposed to create 2-3 paragraphs for at least 3 references, and format it in some specific way. But, I think this doesn't really matter, since papers are inherently free-form, I just wanted to mention it in case other students give you low scores/no comments/complain about it.

I feel your references are relevant and interesting. I also think that the chart that you've made is a good comparison of different techniques to validate work.

I would love to see you pick a specific method of validation, and go into detail on different columns of the table (Advantage, Risks, Vuln ident'n, Cost, Underlying BC).
