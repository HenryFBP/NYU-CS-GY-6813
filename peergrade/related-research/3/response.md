# Q1
> Does the author describe how their solution is different from current methods in related research?

No.

The description of the solution ("implement random logic to change [...] bot detection", "have match calculation with the pictures", "the bot detection and capturing the person or computer details") is hard to understand. 

The problem is also hard to understand ("determine the Good Bot vs Bad one"), but after reading reference [1] I can understand it to be "Preventing automated attacks against websites" and the solution is something like "Enhancing CAPTCHAs to be machine-resistant". 

This submission should be rewritten and expanded, because in its current form it is hard to understand, too short, and poorly worded.

# Q2
> Did the author miss any papers that should have been included?

Yes.

There is a low amount of papers. Consider looking into these areas:

- Machine Learning and CAPTCHAs
  - Injecting noise to attack ML image detection
- Modern browser automation (Selenium)
- Browser fingerprinting
- Browser spoofing

# Q3
> Based on your responses to the previous questions, please rate your classmate's response to this prompt and provide a brief written explanation for your rating.

3 - Below Average

FYI - There was a prompt that had an outline for how to create the "related research" section -- I missed it as well, because it was not present in the 'peergrade.io' website. We're supposed to create 2-3 paragraphs for at least 3 references, and format it in some specific way.

"Good Bot, Bad Bot: Characterizing Automated Browsing Activity" is a good paper to start with. It frames your problem well and you might want to use it to base your problem statement and other areas of this paper off of.

However, this is a great topic and still very applicable to our current world. CAPTCHAs can be beaten with image recognition ML frameworks easily. Augmenting them to be more resilient to bots would be a great addition.

You may want to look at "Machine learning and Selenium" on google - or read this https://medium.com/@ageitgey/how-to-break-a-captcha-system-in-15-minutes-with-machine-learning-dbebb035a710 for more ideas.
