# Problem Domain

My problem domain will be ransomware, specifically looking at how disclosure requirements, cybersecurity insurance, and outright bans on paying threat actors adjust the decision made by ransomware victims of whether to pay or not.

This decision is important because while it may benefit an individual organization to pay, doing so finances criminals and makes such attacks profitable on average. While this particular issue might not be solved by code, I hope to gather evidence to build a model to estimate costs and benefits to victim organizations to estimate how various policies would shift the volume of victims who pay the attackers.

# Introduction
Ransomware is a growing threat for enterprises across industries and sizes. Companies remain at risk that an attacker will gain access and swiftly spread malware on their corporate network, encrypting every file and leaving ransom notes behind detailing how the victim organization has to pay to regain access to their data and their environment. Oftentimes companies will quietly pay the ransom and, at present in the US, face no disclosure requirements. As such, the scope of the problem can be difficult to measure, but CyberSecurity Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in cybersecurity startups, estimated that the global cost to business was $20 billion in 2021 and could grow tenfold over the next decade. 

While general cybersecurity standards can help protect a wide range of attacks including ransomware, various politicians and experts have proposed their own ways to target ransomware specifically, in the hopes of discouraging payment of the ransom, and thus decreasing the incentives to attack. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren has introduced a bill to create mandatory disclosure requirements and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm went as far as to support a complete ban on ransomware payments. Less discussed however, would be a novel solution which lies between such solutions: a pigovian tax on ransomware payments.

# Hypothesis
While mandatory disclosure is a necessary first step, governments should then pursue a gradually increasing punitive tax on ransomware payments. This policy has been discussed in passing in the literature, but the focus of the existing literature is on banning payments entirely.
