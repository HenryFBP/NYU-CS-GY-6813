## Mention something that your classmate could improve at 📝

There's not enough content -- 

Problem domain could be more detailed.

It would be nice to see a short outline of:

- This is the current trend of pacemakers
  - do they use bluetooth?
  - do they encrypt?
  - are they low-power devices?
  - what debug info do they leak (if any?)
- This is the current trend of implantable devices as a whole
  - etc etc
- These 3 companies supply 79% of the top X pacemakers, etc

STRIDE Model could be more detailed.

There is no attack tree/further modeling after the STRIDE model. It would be nice to see you expand on what happens with malicious inputs, on logging, on DoS, etc. Or perhaps use a 2nd model.
