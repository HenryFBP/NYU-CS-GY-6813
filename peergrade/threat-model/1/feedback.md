## Mention something that your classmate did well 👍

The problem domain is very interesting and relevant to current state-of-the-art industry. Establishing Command and Control in a covert way has been performed before, and assuming that one's network is secure could lead to a more devastating breach later on.

The attack tree and STRIDE model are solid. Perhaps you could give some guesstimates on impact quantitatively/qualitatively.

## Mention something that your classmate could improve at 📝

Looking into zero-trust security/zero-trust networking models could be a good research topic.

Perhaps you could also look at a breakdown of common network setups of industrial production systems, or a detailed breakdown of how STUXNET was able to destroy the centrifuges, to further understand how improved security protocols could harden industrial networks.
