No


ADDITIONAL COMMENT

I read through the explanation section at the beginning and some of the other comments in the document. I agree that I think you should try to narrow this down a bit more to a single use case. For instance, if you are comparing the effectiveness of two software vulnerability scanning tools, you could maybe get raw numeric metrics.


QUESTION 2 OF 3
Can you suggest additional measurements or chart types that could be used?

As I explained above, recommend finding a method to pull metrics depending on what you narrow this down to, and creating visuals based on that data.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT

I think more work will be needed to get this narrowed down as mentioned above. On a different topic, I had a bit of an issue reading this document. It looks like it wasn't saved quite right (filename was a GUID and lacked file extension), so I had to pull out the magic bytes and figure out that it was a ODT. Not sure if others reviewing this will run into the same problem, but just wanted to let you know.

Thanks for this. I totally forgot to convert this to PDF. I kind of wish peergrade blocked any non-"doc/docx/pdf" filetypes.
