I see good summaries of the papers and your takeaways, but I don't see how your solution is different from current methods in research.

That's something I need to work on. I think my paper is currently more of a "survey of existing research", and I don't actually propose any kind of model at all. I need to either: Propose a model and explain why it's different, or I can stop saying I have a model when I don't, and just change this paper into a summary of existing research.

Recommend reviewing what Prof Olmstead said in his lecture notes for this assignment: • Sentence 1 - Talks about what they do...cite it. i.e. [Last Name 1 and Last Name 2 or Last Name 1 et. al.] do X. • Sentence 2 - Explain why this does not work (or work well) for your problem. • Sentence 3 - Explain what you do differently. How do you build on what they did.
