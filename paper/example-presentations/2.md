## Title
## Outline
-   Introduction
-   Performance
-   Footprint
-   Security
-   Conclusion
## Cloud Computing 
-   (diagram of what cc is)
## Virtualization Architectures 
-   (diagram of what type 1 virt'n vs type 2 virt'n is)
## Introduction to OSv
-   What is OSv, also list of features
## Motivation
-   Is it truly advantageous to use OSv?
-   we will look at performance, memory, and footprinting
## Performance
-   most material is from paper called "Hypervisors vs Lightweight Containerization"
## Performance Test Setup
-   list of specs
-   table of software versions
## CPU
-   perf graph for MFLOPS per kb of data for different virt'n software
## Memory
-   perf graph for MB of memory throughput per second for different virt'n software
## Network
-   perf table for txn/sec of UDP and TCP packets
## Overall Performance
-   CPU is equivalent, but OSv memory throughput much lower than linux, and OSv network throughput is slightly higher than linux
## Footprinting
-   empirical evidence
## VM Setup
-   vm configuration
## Footprinting results
-   list of images by size,memory,threads,ports
## Security Considerations
